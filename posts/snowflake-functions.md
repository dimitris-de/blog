  SELECT DATEDIFF(month, '2023-01-01', '2023-12-31') AS months_difference;
  ```

- **`TO_TIMESTAMP`**: Converts a string to a timestamp.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP('2023-01-01 12:00:00') AS timestamp;
  ```

### Mathematical Functions

Mathematical functions perform numerical operations and calculations.

- **`ABS`**: Returns the absolute value.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT ABS(-10) AS absolute;
  ```

- **`ROUND`**: Rounds a number to the nearest integer or specified decimal places.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT ROUND(123.456, 2) AS rounded_number;
  ```

- **`CEIL` / `FLOOR`**: Rounds a number up or down to the nearest integer.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT CEIL(123.456) AS ceiling, FLOOR(123.456) AS floor;
  ```

- **`POWER`**: Raises a number to the specified power.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT POWER(2, 3) AS result;
  ```

### Conditional Functions

Conditional functions allow you to perform operations based on certain conditions.

- **`CASE`**: Implements conditional logic.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT
      product,
      sales,
      CASE
          WHEN sales > 1000 THEN 'High'
          WHEN sales BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Medium'
          ELSE 'Low'
      END AS sales_category
  FROM sales_data;
  ```

- **`NULLIF`**: Returns NULL if two expressions are equal.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT NULLIF(column1, column2) AS result FROM table_name;
  ```

- **`COALESCE`**: Returns the first non-NULL value.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(column1, column2, 'Default') AS value FROM table_name;
  ```

### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **`SUM`**: Calculates the total sum.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales FROM sales_data;
  ```

- **`AVG`**: Calculates the average.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(sales_amount) AS average_sales FROM sales_data;
  ```

- **`COUNT`**: Counts the number of rows.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM sales_data;
  ```

- **`MAX` / `MIN`**: Finds the maximum or minimum value.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(sales_amount) AS highest_sale, MIN(sales_amount) AS lowest_sale FROM sales_data;
  ```

### JSON Functions

JSON functions handle JSON data, allowing you to parse and extract information from JSON objects.

- **`PARSE_JSON`**: Parses a string into a JSON object.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT PARSE_JSON('{"key": "value"}') AS json_data;
  ```

- **`TO_VARIANT`**: Converts data to a variant type.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT TO_VARIANT(column1) AS variant_data FROM table_name;
  ```

- **`GET_PATH`**: Extracts a value from a JSON object using a specified path.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT json_column:get_path('key') AS extracted_value FROM table_name;
  ```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Parsing JSON Data

Suppose you have a table `events` with a column `event_data` containing JSON strings. You want to extract the `user_id` and `event_type` from each JSON object.

```sql
SELECT
    PARSE_JSON(event_data):user_id::STRING AS user_id,
    PARSE_JSON(event_data):event_type::STRING AS event_type
FROM
    events;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`PARSE_JSON(event_data)`**: Converts the JSON string into a JSON object.
- **`:user_id` / `:event_type`**: Extracts the respective fields.
- **`::STRING`**: Casts the extracted values to string type.

### Example 2: Data Transformation with String Functions

You have a table `customers` with a `full_name` column in the format "Last, First". You want to split this into separate `first_name` and `last_name` columns.

```sql
SELECT
    TRIM(SUBSTRING(full_name, POSITION(',' IN full_name) + 1)) AS first_name,
    TRIM(SUBSTRING(full_name, 1, POSITION(',' IN full_name) - 1)) AS last_name
FROM
    customers;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`POSITION(',' IN full_name)`**: Finds the position of the comma.
- **`SUBSTRING`**: Extracts the first and last names based on the comma position.
- **`TRIM`**: Removes any leading or trailing spaces.

### Example 3: Date Calculations

You have a table `subscriptions` with `start_date` and `end_date` columns. You want to calculate the duration of each subscription in days.

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    DATEDIFF(day, start_date, end_date) AS subscription_duration
FROM
    subscriptions;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`DATEDIFF(day, start_date, end_date)`**: Calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.

## Best Practices

- **Use Descriptive Aliases:** When using functions, assign meaningful aliases to make your queries more readable.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS first_name_upper FROM users;
  ```

- **Handle NULLs Appropriately:** Use functions like `COALESCE` or `NULLIF` to manage NULL values and prevent unexpected results.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(email, 'no-email@example.com') AS contact_email FROM users;
  ```

- **Optimize Function Usage:** Apply functions judiciously, especially on large datasets, to maintain query performance. Avoid unnecessary computations within SELECT statements.

- **Leverage Built-in Functions:** Familiarize yourself with Snowflake's extensive library of functions to utilize them effectively instead of writing custom logic.

- **Document Complex Logic:** If your queries involve intricate function combinations, add comments to explain the logic for future reference and maintenance.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Overusing Functions in WHERE Clauses:** Applying functions directly in WHERE clauses can hinder the use of indexes and degrade performance. Instead, consider computing values beforehand or restructuring your queries.

  ```sql
  -- Less Efficient
  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023;

  -- More Efficient
  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
  ```

- **Ignoring Data Types:** Ensure that you are aware of the data types you are working with to prevent type mismatches and casting errors.

  ```sql
  -- Potential Issue
  SELECT SUM(price) FROM products;

  -- Ensure Correct Data Type
  SELECT SUM(price::NUMBER) FROM products;
  ```

- **Not Handling NULLs Properly:** Failing to account for NULL values can lead to unexpected results, especially in aggregate functions and conditional logic.

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions; -- NULLs are ignored
  ```

- **Complex Nested Functions:** Overly nesting functions can make queries difficult to read and maintain. Break down complex operations into simpler steps or use Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

  ```sql
  WITH processed_data AS (
      SELECT
          UPPER(TRIM(name)) AS clean_name,
          DATEDIFF(day, start_date, end_date) AS duration
      FROM
          projects
  )
  SELECT * FROM processed_data WHERE duration > 30;
  ```
